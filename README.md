# Unit-1-Challenge
#Description- The Unit-1 Challenge asked us to take a look at the source code for a Horiseon Webpage and update it to make it more accessible to end-users, which helps in search-engine optimization.

#Actions Taken- I traded out most non-semantic elements for semantic elements and gave the title tag a better description. I also add alternate attributes to image sources.
